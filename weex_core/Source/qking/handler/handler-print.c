#ifndef QKING_NDEBUG

/**
 * Provide a 'print' implementation for scripts.
 *
 * The routine converts all of its arguments to strings and outputs them
 * char-by-char using qkingx_port_handler_print_char.
 *
 * The NUL character is output as "\u0000", other characters are output
 * bytewise.
 *
 * Note:
 *      This implementation does not use standard C `printf` to print its
 *      output. This allows more flexibility but also extends the core
 *      Qking engine port API. Applications that want to use
 *      `qkingx_handler_print` must ensure that their port implementation also
 *      provides `qkingx_port_handler_print_char`.
 *
 * @return undefined - if all arguments could be converted to strings,
 *         error - otherwise.
